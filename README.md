# AgileEngine

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.29.

## Development server

In the future, running `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The app is not working, cause I wasn't able to remember almost anything about Angular Material and took the bad call to search in google each time an error appeared. So, two hours wasn't enough.

For the other hand, I tried to show most of the things I usually do while I code, and I think it has a good approach. 

I think I will have one hour on tuesday to make the code, at least, compile and works fine. If you are okey with that, please let me know.

Total time spent (including writing this a pushing) = 2:30hs.
